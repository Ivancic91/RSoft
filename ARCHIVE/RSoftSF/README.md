# DESCRIPTION OF FILES

- monodispersed_standard.SF.nc : a set of structure functions for
monodispersed systems with all particles of type = 1. The radius of the
particles is assumed to be ~1. The cutoff radius of this set is 
Rc = 2.473113.

- monodispersed_radial.SF.nc : a set of structure functions for 
monodispersed systems with all particles of type = 1. The radius of the 
particles is assumed to be ~1. Only radial structure functions are used 
which should make computation of structure functions faster than the 
standard version. The cutoff radius of this set is Rc = 2.457298.

- monodispersed_radial_short.SF.nc : a set of structure functions for
monodispersed systems with all particles of type = 1. The radius of the 
particles is assumed to be ~1. Only radial structure functions are used 
which should make computation of structure functions faster than the 
standard version. Large radial structure functions have also been pruned
to keep the cutoff radius short and speed up the computations. The 
cutoff radius of this set is Rc = 1.507298.
